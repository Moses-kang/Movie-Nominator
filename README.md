This program allows users to look up all existing films and adding them to a list. User can add up to 5 different movies and choose to delete any one. 
This is a project to practice my Front-end programing and JavaScript. No frameworks were used. 

## Some improvements and thoughts moving forward
One big issue is the speed and reliability of the site. I think that using React.js would allow me to load in the site and the information singinificantly faster with less errors. One of the biggest errors was that sometimes (on rare occassions) the incorrect film would load in the detailed.html page. This most likely has to do with the slower loading times as the page loads faster than the api call.
